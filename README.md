# Age Estimation
This project deals with linear regression analysis for Age Estimation. Cumputation of Mean Absolute Error and Cumulative Score is utilized to folow up in Regression Tree.
We received the plots for the visualization of cumulative error. 
Age estimation in cadavers, human remains and living individuals may clarify issues with significant legal and social ramifications for individuals as well as for the community.
In such cases methods for estimating age should fulfil the following specific demands: 
## (1) They must have been presented to the scientific community, as a rule by publication in peer-reviewed journals
## (2) Clear information concerning accuracy of age estimation by the method should be available
## (3) The methods need to be sufficiently accurate 
## (4) In cases of age estimation in living individuals principles of medical ethics and legal regulations have to be considered. We have identified and summarized the methods that essentially fulfil these specific demands.
